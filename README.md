# apps
I analyzed a college data set that I got from Kaggle. I analyzed data set using Python. There were a lot of variables. I focused on the variables I thought were important which were the collegename, if the school was private or not, the number of applications, the number of people who were accepted, the number of people who enrolled, and others. I also did value counts of the variables and made a lot of visualizations. I had pie charts, histograms, and box and whiskers plot. For one of the pie charts, I analyzed how many schools were private and how many schools were not private. I had one histogram that showed how frequent the costs of the room and board were and another histogram showing how frequent the number of books were. For the box and whiskers plots, I was focusing on the graduating rate and also the cost of books.
